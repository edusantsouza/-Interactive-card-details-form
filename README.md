## My process

My experience was pretty good developing this challenge. All about this project taught me something and, believe me, I really had to learn some hard contents (at least for me) to accomplish this task. I wish I could say that was easy. But it wasn't. And I will talk a bit about this process further ahead.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries
- Javascript for DOM Manipulation

### What I learned

It is a simple project in a first look, but, when you stop and think about all the details the application must attend, so you realize that its a high challenge. So I put myself to work on it and spent a bunch of hours practicing concepts that I already "learn", but I've never applied before. I could understand:

  - How the eventlisteners works on input fields;
  - I was able to apply diferents iterations methods and this help a lot to validate some infos from user side; and
  - DOM manipulating was far the most important thing to understand when passing input values to the side card on page.
   
  With these tools I could finish the project and learned better by practicing .


### Continued development

Well, I can easy say that in this project I struggled a lot with CSS positioning properties. Seriously, that makes me realize how bad I am on that. Or I was(spoiler alert: I had to learn it to finish the challenge). Actually,  I read and watched a ton of classes about it but never really practiced positioning. It could seems foolish, but that was the struggle I had to go through to show me where I can get better and now I really know. Its my main objective from now on and you can see my progress very soon in another project.
